# FlutterDoc

A bot offering exactly what we need in [The r/FlutterDev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rflutterdev) that Dyno can't offer us.
* Quick search patterns that can be embedded in discussion
  * `The following syntax returns the documentation for a ![Class], it can be embedded in a discussion and you can mention multiple ![Classes] in a single sentence.`
  * `If you're not sure of what you want, use ?[Class] to search for it.`
  * `If you're looking for a &[package], this is the syntax that searches on pub for you.`
  * `You can ![Mix] and &[match] them in ?[any] order you ![Desire], it'll ?[Handle] each &[invidivually].`
* Nags users reposting a message in multiple channels when that message is
  * Sufficiently lengthy (30 characters)
  * One of the last 5 messages in any channel
